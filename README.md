# Employee Satisfaction & Turnover Prediction Project

## Business Problem Statement

**The Challenge:**
Our organization faces significant financial and operational challenges due to employee turnover. Current turnover rates of 18% annually result in direct costs of approximately $15,000 per departure when accounting for recruitment, onboarding, training, and lost productivity during transition periods. Beyond direct costs, high turnover disrupts team dynamics, reduces institutional knowledge, impacts customer relationships, and places additional burden on remaining employees.

**Current State Limitations:**
- **Reactive Approach**: We currently address turnover after employees have already decided to leave, limiting our ability to intervene effectively
- **Limited Insights**: Exit interviews provide retrospective feedback but don't identify at-risk employees before they disengage
- **One-Size-Fits-All Solutions**: Without understanding individual risk factors, retention strategies lack personalization and effectiveness
- **Manager Blind Spots**: Supervisors often lack early warning signals to identify struggling or disengaged team members

**Business Impact:**
- **Financial**: Annual turnover costs estimated at $1.8 million across the organization
- **Operational**: 12-16 weeks average time-to-productivity for new hires
- **Strategic**: Loss of high-performers and critical knowledge creates competitive disadvantages
- **Cultural**: High turnover rates can create negative perception cycles affecting employer brand
